# EDTCommissionsReport

EDTCommissionsReport is an interface that runs on an AWS server under Tomcat.  It uploads a spreadsheet for a particular communications firm and uses its data to calculate & display the commissions for the salespeople.  There is also a section on the interface to calculate the salesperson commissions if the user only has the check amount.

Itâ€™s written in Java & requires access to the Apache POI library to process the spreadsheets.
